Welcome to my personal website!

On here I will be showcasing my adventures in a trip report/blog format. I want to give others the opportunity to learn about these rad locations and how to explore them on their own! I plan on expanding this site to better showcase what I've been working on in all aspects of my life and keep it as a sort of history of all I have done.
