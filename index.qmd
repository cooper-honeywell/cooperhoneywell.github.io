## About me! 

My name is Cooper Honeywell. I am a 3rd year Environmental Studies B.S. student at UCSB, graduated in 2025. I am originally from Lake Tahoe, and have a deep affinity for anything outdoors. I have been skiing, backpacking, rock climbing, and mountain biking from a very young age. Since moving to Santa Barbara, I have developed a strong connection with the ocean through freedive spearfishing, scuba diving, and surfing. I was the President of the UCSB Scuba and Freedive Club along with a staff memeber with the Excursion Club.
