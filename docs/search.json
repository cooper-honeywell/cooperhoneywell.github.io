I am originally from Lake Tahoe, and have a deep affinity for anything outdoors. I have been skiing, backpacking, rock climbing, and mountain biking from a very young age. Since moving to Santa Barbara, I have developed a strong connection with the ocean through freedive spearfishing, scuba diving, and surfing. I was the President of the UCSB Scuba and Freedive Club along with a staff memeber with the Excursion Club."
