    "text": "A group of 40 of us recently embarked on an incredible canoe trip on the Colorado River just below the Hoover Dam in Nevada/Arizona. We launched our canoes 8 miles south of the dam and spent the first day paddling 6 miles up river until we reached our camp. Contrary to the majority of the Colorado River, the water coming out of the dam is extremely clear and cold, making it a refreshing treat in the desert heat. On the second day of the trip, we explore the top 2 miles of the section. Here there is a super high concentration of hot springs, coming straight out of the ground and rock. The sides of the valley are covered in enticing caves and side canyons. There is one cave called the sauna cave that is a man made, pitch black tunnel into the rock that hot water seeps into, creating a “natural” sauna. You get a view of the dam in its entirety, and then get to enjoy the float back down river with the current.\n\n\n\n\nThe Channel Islands are definitely one of my top places I have ever had the chance to explore. They offer such unique sense of desolation and host a rich marine ecosystem. I have had a few recent dive trips out there, my favorites include a spearfishing and lobster diving trip on a friends boat, and a scuba diving trip with the UCSB Scuba and Freedive Club.\nI love being able to explore the incredible marine protected areas that the Channel Islands have to offer, some of which have been protected for almost 50 years. I also love the opportunity to freedive in the areas open to recreational fishing, being able to practice spearfishing, one of the most selective and sustainable food harvesting practices if done correctly.\nMy most recent scuba diving trip, we got to dive on the East end of Anacapa where there is some of the thickest kelp in all the islands and super rich biodiversity on the reef. I saw a lobster that had to be around 75 years old and weigh 25 pounds. I also got to play hide and go seek with a curious sea lion.\nFreediving on Santa Cruz island, I was able to catch my personal best lobster, get some delicious scallops, and bring home a Sheepshead that I turned into a ton of ceviche to share with my friends!"

    "text": "Big Adventures:\n\nNepal\nI had the incredible opportunity to study abroad in Nepal on a field study program with Wildlands Studies. As a class of 18 students, 2 TAs, our profesor, and a Nepali guide team, we trekked for 32 days through the Himalaya. we began in the green, wet, foothills, and trekked up deep river gorges, visiting Buddhist monasteries, mountain villages, and reached a peak elevation of 17,000’.\n\n\nDuring an acclimatazation hike near the Chinese border, some of my peers and I were so lucky to observe the ever elusive Snow Leopard. I feel extremely blessed and lucky to have had this opportunity at all as the Snow Leppard is one of the least studied large cats due to their elusiveness and scattered habitats. Nonetheless, this day is without a doubt one of the best days of my life and I will never forget what it felt like to be in the presence of such an animal.\n\nWe also were able to explore the southern border of the country where wild rhinos, crocodiles and tigers roam the forests and river.\n\nThis entire experience was by far the most personally impactful thing I have ever done and I feel extremely grateful that I was able to use this towards the completion of my degree.\n\n\nIndonesia/Thailand\nAfter I left Nepal, I had over a month before I had to be back in California for school so I took that opportunity to explore parts of Southeast Asia. I backpacked around Thailand, some with friends and some alone, scuba diving and exploring the islands in the south, and trekking to remote villages and caves in the north.\n\nI then met Katie, my girlfriend, in Indonesia. We traveled through parts of Bali, getting some of the best surf of my life, Nusa Penida, where we got to experience a more genuine welcoming community, Lombok where we visited the base of Mount Rinjani, and the surfing town of Kuta, and finally relaxed on the tiny island of Gili Air."
