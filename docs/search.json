I am originally from Lake Tahoe, and have a deep affinity for anything outdoors. I have been skiing, backpacking, rock climbing, and mountain biking from a very young age. Since moving to Santa Barbara, I have developed a strong connection with the ocean through freedive spearfishing, scuba diving, and surfing. I was the President of the UCSB Scuba and Freedive Club along with a staff memeber with the Excursion Club."

    "text": "A group of 40 of us recently embarked on an incredible canoe trip on the Colorado River just below the Hoover Dam in Nevada/Arizona. We launched our canoes 8 miles south of the dam and spent the first day paddling 6 miles up river until we reached our camp. Contrary to the majority of the Colorado River, the water coming out of the dam is extremely clear and cold, making it a refreshing treat in the desert heat. On the second day of the trip, we explore the top 2 miles of the section. Here there is a super high concentration of hot springs, coming straight out of the ground and rock. The sides of the valley are covered in enticing caves and side canyons. There is one cave called the sauna cave that is a man made, pitch black tunnel into the rock that hot water seeps into, creating a “natural” sauna. You get a view of the dam in its entirety, and then get to enjoy the float back down river with the current."
